# Poroject 2 - Image Classification
This is my second project submission for the Udacity Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree. 6 weeks ago I was completely new to programming so this was a bit of stretch for me. 

A large amount of the code was provided in the beginning. The project required the 'TO DO' sections to be filled in.

I struggled with adjusting the parameters for this network. You can see what layers I added/removed within the comments. 

I ended up getting just over 50% accuracy for a CIFAR-10 dataset. 

How I could improve: 
  - Fix parameters
  - Add more layers (convolution layers and fully connected layers)
  - Batch normalization (at this point I'm not entirely sure what this means but I will find out)

I learned an incredible amount through this project. I'm excited for the next module about RNN's.
